################## Finding chimeras in short high - throughtput sequencing reads #######################
######################################################################################################

# This script aims to identify chimeric short reads resulting from some form of recombination between two genomes. The script only searches for evidence of recombination within reads.
# It is not designed to find recombination junction between reads (in the case of paired - reads). But paired - reads can be used to search for recombination events within reads.
# The reads are first used as queries to perform a blastn search on all genomes between which recombination events are searched.
# blastn (v2.4.0+) command used to generate blastn outputs (default option megablast) for genome1 : blastn  - query reads.fasta  - db genome1.fasta  - outfmt 6  - max_target_seqs 2  - out blastOnGenome1.txt
# The same command should be used to generate blastn outputs for other genomes of interest.
# The same command should be used to generate blastn outputs for other genomes of interest.
